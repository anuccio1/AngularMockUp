This is a mock up of the following wireframe: https://dribbble.com/shots/1168219-2-Movie-Service-UI/attachments/152522

I used the following libraries:
	Angular.js
	lodash
	jquery
	font awesome (cdn)
	grunt
	ES6 (grunt-babel to compile)

To get movie data, I used the OMDB API: http://omdbapi.com/ (all real data).

I implemented the following:
	Searching for movies
	Discover page
	Top Charts page
	New Releases page
	sort by popularity/release
	detail view of movies
	refresh at top
	mock buddy list on right
	chat filter
	mock chat window (doesn't store the message history)


To run, open up index.html in a recent version of Chrome (i have Version 46.0.2490.71 (64-bit))

If you would like to see my javascript code, look at main.js (this transpiles into main-built.js (ES6-> ES5))
